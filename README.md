Our challenge topic is Turning STEM into STEAM[https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/steam/details](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/steam/details). We chose different images collected by James Webb Space Telescope, and transformed them into music. We also set up a web application to let user interact with our program. Specifically, the user can upload a custom audio and choose a image, we transform the image into sound and match with the audio that the user provided to create new style music. This Github repo mainly shows the core algorithm that we do load audio file, extract keys, load image, convert to audio with musical inverse spectrogram technique, and sonification.
